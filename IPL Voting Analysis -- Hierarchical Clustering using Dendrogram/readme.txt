Unsupervised Learning : Hierarchical Clustering

As the name suggests its an algorithm that builds hierarchy of clusters

Dataset :

I took a dataset for Indian Premier League 2018 edition's tournament, 
which we play in our office for fun, where in every participant need to predict the winner of each match. 
It ends with bottom Y people treating top X :)

Goal :

Form cluster(s) of all the particpating members based on their voting pattern [ Total 60 matches]

Implementation :

Hierarchical Clustering using Dendrogram [ Unsupervised Learning visualization, without needing to specify the number of clusters]

Code :

Pardon the documentation, this was written on a lazy Friday afternoon!

Outcome :

I could see that many of the members in the initial clusters are from same team,which meant they
discussed their votes before predicting and voted same for most number of matches 
( Against the tournament rules :D)
